## Motivation

As iOS developer I follow a lot of developers on Twitter. It's painful every time I saw a rdar:// in Tweetbot but cannot tap it to open. Therefore I created Ladybug, a solution for iOS to open or bookmark a Radar link. 

I use a lot of tools made by other developers. And I always want to contribute something to the community. With Ladybug I finally found something: 1. I need 2. others might need too 3. I can do. Consider Ladybug as my love letter to the dev community. üòç Enjoy!
