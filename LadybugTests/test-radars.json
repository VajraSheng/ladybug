Most of time these files cannot be use across different Xcode versions. \n\nFor example, when trying on New Build System between the legacy one, or Xcode 10 between Xcode 9, we often need to Clean Build Folder or the build will failed.\n\nThese issues can be solved by introduce path settings per Xcode version. Or I believe you can find a better solution so that developers don't need to Clean Build Folder after switching to a different Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a project on Xcode 9.3.1 and build it with New Build System (Shared Workspace Settings)\n2. Close Xcode 9.3.1\n3.
